## Project Introduction
Text documents are essential as they are one of the richest sources of data for 
businesses. Text documents often contain crucial information which might shape 
the market trends or influence the investment flows. Therefore, companies often 
hire analysts to monitor the trend via articles posted online, tweets on social media 
platforms such as Twitter or articles from newspaper. However, some companies 
may wish to only focus on articles related to technologies and politics. Thus, 
filtering of the articles into different categories is required.

## How to Install and Run the Project
1. Download the file
2. Load in Spyder
3. run F5 (dont change the code unnesscary to avoid preogramme malfunction)
4. let the training to begin
5. open spyder command prompt to load TensorBoard with logs using --logdir <filepath>
6. If no error is thrown, go to any browser and type localhost:6006 to see the graph plots
